# üç∫ brew-dual-plugin (Dual Homebrew Management)

I built this plugin to **easily manage packages** on **both Apple Silicon (`/opt/homebrew`) and Intel (`/usr/local`) Homebrew installations**. It‚Äôs a simple tool that I use personally, but I figured **someone else might find it useful too!**

---

## üöÄ Why I Made This

I often switch between **x86 and ARM architectures** on macOS, and managing Homebrew packages on both can be a hassle, especially when manage dependencies for dual architecture. This script **installs, uninstalls, update, upgrade and checks packages** across both environments automatically (check available command using **brew-dual help**), so I don‚Äôt have to think about it.

## üöÄ Improvement

On version **_1.0.1_** brew-dual support for **_check-binary_** package & **_merge-package_** to universal2

**_Check binary package use_**

```
brew dual check-binary <package>
```

**_Check binary package use_**

```
brew dual merge-package <package>
```

by default merge package replace the package in arm homebrew, but you can change it with --merge-path=<path>
with custom path, make package with universal2 not associated with homebrew

## üìå Installation

Before installing, ensure that **both Apple Silicon and x86 Homebrew are installed**. If not, the plugin will guide you through the setup when you run:

\*\*\* For safety don't forget to add or replace homebrew path if existing in zprofile, zshrc, bash_profile or bashrc with:

```
if [ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ]; then
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
else
    eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi
```

\*\*\* this plugin include with alias for brew arm and x86 architecture:

```
brew-arm
```

\*\*\* can use without "-", like:

```
brew arm list
```

## And

```
brew-x86
```

\*\*\* can use without "-", like:

```
brew x86 list
```
